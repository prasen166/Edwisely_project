I have created a simple front end page just to demonstrate edwisely page sample page where students can directly ask some doubts regarding there issues

the index.html page is created inside the temp folders

I have return a python code (flask) in the backend integrating the front end with the oepnai api so that it can do the assistance easily
Created .env folder to enter the openai key

extra dependencies we can use this command to download
pip install Flask openai python-dotenv

Later run python app.py to directly use the app


Additionally i am working on study genie too which is kind of a big project i have created a demo html version of that please check that out too
Study genie helps in doubt clarifiication and many other things this is the workflow i have to decided to implement

ðŸš€ Edwisely StudyGenie AI Demo
Tagline: "Your Personal Learning Companion That Understands How You Learn"

This project is a demo prototype for StudyGenie AI, an intelligent study assistant designed for Edwisely to tackle common student challenges like identifying knowledge gaps, getting real-time help, and personalizing study plans.

âœ¨ What This Demo Shows:
This interactive HTML demo highlights two core AI features:

Conversational Study Assistant: Chat with StudyGenie in natural language to get instant explanations for engineering concepts. It's designed to guide students with a "Socratic method" approach, encouraging deeper understanding.

Simulated Adaptive Learning: Experience how StudyGenie could intelligently detect knowledge gaps and generate personalized study plans. Click the scenario buttons to see dynamic plan adaptations based on simulated student performance (e.g., struggling with B+ Trees or SQL Joins).

The actual points i want to add are here below 
1. Conversational Study Assistant
2. Adaptive Knowledge Gap Detection
3. Intelligent Study Plan Generator
4. Smart Assessment Feedback Engine
